            <p>In my opinion, I would not buy the phone. As good as the deal sounds, it is morally wrong. Some people, who only care about money, woulod buy the phone without a glimpse of guilt or remorse. I think the world is more than money, and respect myself enough to not take a deal, as I would feel guilty, and it would not be the right thing to do. I can understand for a low income person, but I would not buy the phone unless absolutely necessary, and even then I would feel guilty. </p>
