<center><h1>Three Reasons to NOT Buy the Iphone</h1></center>
    <left><p>1. The iPhones are illegally owned, and could be traced back to me if I was to buy one, resulting in, most likely, jail time.</p></left>

    <left><p>2. It is immoral to buy the iPhone, as they are stolen, and if your argument is money is everything and you don't care where the object came from as long as it is cheap, your thought process is not where it should be.</p></left>
    
    <left><p>3.Since the iPhone is illegal, and not registered, all you could do is resell it as you can't make it work as your own if you do not get it from a phone company/Apple itself.</p></left>
