    <h3>Some Activities I do</h3>
    <h4>Some activities I participate in is volunteering for homeless shelters, and for the organization "Food Forward," who collect extra fruit and vegetables at local farmers markets for homeless shelters. I also play club soccer, as well as play for my high school team as the captain.</h4>
    <h4>I currently attend Providence High School, and enjoy it. My favorite subject in school is English, as I find it very interesting, and I get a dopamine rush when I can find foreshadowing in a story. </h4>
    <h4>I enjoy hanging out with friends, and going to parties.</h4>
    <h4>I like many different T.V shows, but I especially enjoy Stranger Things, The Walking Dead, and Family Guy. I also enjoyed reading the play/book The Crucible.</h4>
